//useEffect is for running code when your component loads or when certain data (like state) changes.
// state is like a variable that keeps track of information inside a component, but with one important difference: React will re-render the component whenever the state changes. In simpler words, state is data that can change over time and affect how the component looks or behaves.
// Side effects = things that happen outside of the componentâ€™s rendering process, such as:
// Fetching data from a server.
// Updating the document title.
// Setting up a timer.
